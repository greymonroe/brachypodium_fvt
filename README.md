## Folders
### Data/
The *Data* folder contains raw data used in the study. 

### src/
Contains scripts or other code that will be called from _manuscript.rmd_. Useful for long code. 

### Figures/
The *Figures* folder contains all figures produced by _manuscript.rmd_. I prefer to produce figures in _.pdf_ format.

### Tables/
The _Tables_ folder has all tables created by _manuscript.rmd_. These are tables that will be submitted with your manuscrupt for publication, not tables of data used for analyses.

### Manuscript/
The *Manuscript* folder contains the _manuscript.rmd_ file which has all code for analyses and creation of figures and tables, citations, and of course the wirtten content of the paper. This is the main file you will work with and is used to build the manuscript with this line in R. Open _manuscript.rmd_ in RStudio and use the "Knit" button to build your manuscript.

This folder will also contain the output manuscript files in _.pdf_ and _.tex_ formats created when you build (Knit) your manuscript. 

The _.bib_ file in this folder contains all references.
